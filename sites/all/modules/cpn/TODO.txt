TODO
----
- keep syntax highlighting on if it was on when previewing or if validation fails
  - would need to enable it when the parent fieldset expands
    - could put a listener on the fieldset?
- make "enabled by default" an option on a setting page
- can we add node revision support?
  - would we have to move the CSS & JS fields to node_revisions?
